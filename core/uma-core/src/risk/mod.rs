//! File risk scoring: the deterministic "pain score".
//!
//! Ports the *deterministic* half of Proposal 04 (docs/proposals/04): a file's
//! history of corrections, reverts, and churn becomes a 0–100 score with a
//! three-band policy. It is deliberately offline and reproducible — `cargo
//! test` exercises the exact formula production uses — and it is **advisory**:
//! it feeds warnings and prompts, never blocks by itself. Probabilistic
//! judgment (Jev) may refine it later, but the floor must not depend on a
//! network model.
