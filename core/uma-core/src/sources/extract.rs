//! Candidate extraction from agent sessions.
//!
//! A session is conversation; a fact is one atomic, durable claim. This module
//! proposes which turns are worth keeping, and classifies them by *pattern of
//! language* rather than by understanding them — classification and translation
//! into proper fact titles/bodies is the reviewing agent's job, done with the
//! operator watching through the approval modal. What this extractor guarantees
//! is that the pool it produces is worth reviewing at all.
//!
//! Read-only by construction: candidates describe the session, nothing here
//! touches the store.
