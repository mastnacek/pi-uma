Persistent, evidence-aware memory for [Pi](https://pi.dev). Keep useful preferences,
project context and work progress across sessions—without repeatedly asking the
assistant to remember them.

![Memory learning, context injection and cross-session recall](assets/overview.png)

## Features

- **Learn and update automatically.** Capture requirements, corrections and compaction
  summaries. Update tracked project states from tool observations, with provenance,
  history, gradual decay and evidence-aware ranking.
- **Inject relevant context.** Select memories by the current topic and recent user
  context. Filter weak or stale matches; no relevant match means no unrelated filler.
- **Recall across sessions.** Find background from another session or directory.
  A read-only `memory_recall` tool lets the assistant look up missing context mid-task.

Learning defaults to Pi's active model and existing authentication. Quota/rate limits
or repeated failures can use an available model from another configured provider, without
changing the foreground model. [Fallback and budgets](docs/recovery.md) are configurable;
no separate API key, embedding service or vector database is required.

## Install

Requires **Pi 0.85+** with a working model. npm-based Pi requires **Node.js 22.19+**.

```bash
pi install npm:pi-memory-evolution
```

Or install the Git default branch, with Git and npm available locally:

```bash
pi install https://github.com/btnalit/pi-memory-evolution
```

Choose **one** source, then run these commands inside Pi:

```text
/reload
/memory status
```

`SQLite ok (schema 7)` confirms storage initialization. Continue using Pi normally;
learning and recall run automatically.

## Use

Describe your requirements in a conversation:

```text
Our priorities for atlas-service are automatic backups and reliable recovery.
```

Later, in a fresh session sharing the same memory store:

```text
What do you remember about atlas-service's priorities?
```

Learning is asynchronous and selective—not every message becomes a memory.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/memory list` | Browse memories |
| `/memory search <topic>` | Search relevant claims |
| `/memory show <id>` | Inspect content and evidence |
| `/memory learning` | Inspect capture and actual update results |
| `/memory explain` | Explain the last automatic injection |
| `/memory correct <id> <text>` | Correct a record |
| `/memory forget <id>` | Suppress a record from recall |

See the [usage guide](docs/usage.md) for all commands, migration and troubleshooting.

## Update or uninstall

For the npm installation:

```bash
pi update npm:pi-memory-evolution
pi remove npm:pi-memory-evolution
```

For Git, substitute the repository URL used during installation. Reload or restart
Pi afterward. Uninstalling does not delete memory data. Before a schema-changing
upgrade, stop Pi processes sharing the database and back up the state directory.

## Data and limits

Local SQLite state lives in `~/.pi/agent/agent-suite/memory-evolution/`.
`PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` changes that prefix; different working directories share the
same store by default.

Learning sends filtered source content to the active model, or an allowed fallback provider,
and consumes that provider's quota. Cross-provider fallback is enabled by default; restrict
its allowlist or disable it in [recovery configuration](docs/recovery.md).
Memories are historical evidence, not independently verified facts. Matching and
secret filtering are imperfect; verify important claims. See [privacy and storage](docs/usage.md#local-storage-and-provenance).

## Development

```bash
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run check
npm run test:install
npm run test:pi
npm run build
```

CI checks types, regressions, package contents, installation and fake-model host
integration. Builds produce an installable npm archive and checksums, not a separate
compiled runtime. Release PRs automate versions and changelogs; merging a verified
release PR triggers npm publication. Dependency updates arrive as gated PRs.

See [testing](docs/testing.md) and [release automation](docs/releasing.md).
