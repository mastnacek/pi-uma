# Unipi

23 workspace packages that turn Pi into a full development workstation. Structured workflows, persistent memory, parallel agents, web research, notifications, context management, command autocomplete, and a live status bar — all wired together through a shared event system.

One command installs everything:
```bash
pi install npm:@pi-unipi/unipi
```

> [!TIP]
> **UniPi 3 alpha is out.** Glance footer, long-horizon goals, plan and permission
> modes, Fusion (lead + sidekick), kanboard v3 and more. Try it with:
> ```bash
> pi install npm:@pi-unipi/unipi@alpha
> ```
> Update with `pi update npm:@pi-unipi/unipi@alpha`; go back to stable with
> `pi install npm:@pi-unipi/unipi@latest`. Alpha docs:
> [v3.0.0-alpha branch](https://github.com/Neuron-Mr-White/unipi/tree/v3.0.0-alpha#readme) ·
> [changelog](https://github.com/Neuron-Mr-White/unipi/blob/v3.0.0-alpha/CHANGELOG.md).

## Requirements

- **Pi (`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`) `^0.84.0`** — Unipi 2.9.0 tracks the Pi 0.84 SDK (extension event map incl. `agent_settled`, `ModelRuntime` session options, kitty-protocol keyboard handling). Older Pi releases (0.80–0.83) still load most extensions, but npm will flag the peer dependency mismatch; pin `@pi-unipi/*@<2.9.0` if you must stay on an older Pi.

## What You Get

**[Workflow](./packages/workflow/README.md)** — 20 commands that take ideas to shipped code. Brainstorm, plan, execute in worktrees, review, consolidate. The agent follows skill files step by step.

**[Ralph](./packages/ralph/README.md)** — Long-running loops that persist across sessions. Start a task, iterate through checklist items, resume after crashes. Progress tracked, state saved.

**[Memory](./packages/memory/README.md)** — SQLite + vector search stores facts, preferences, and decisions. Project-scoped and global. The agent remembers what you told it last week.

**[Compactor](./packages/compactor/README.md)** — Zero-LLM context engine. 6-stage pipeline hits 95%+ token reduction at zero API cost. Session continuity, percentage auto-compaction, session recall, and sandbox execution.

**[Prefix-cache architecture](./docs/prefix-cache-architecture.md)** — Append-only request discipline, explicit cache epochs, deterministic tools, privacy-safe diagnostics, provider limitations, and bounded cold-epoch output.

**[Subagents](./packages/subagents/README.md)** — Parallel execution with file locking. Spawn background agents to research, fix, or build while the main agent keeps going.

**[Fusion](./packages/fusion/README.md)** — Run two models as one: a frontier lead delegates to a cheaper persistent sidekick that keeps its own context and shells, and stays in the loop while the sidekick works. Pair them from `/unipi:model`; `/unipi:fusion-stats` shows what the sidekick saved you.

**[Background Tasks](./packages/background-tasks/README.md)** — Long-running commands and delegate agents that survive the turn that started them, with a live dock, output capture, and a wake line while the agent waits on them.

**[Web API](./packages/web-api/README.md)** — Web search, page reading, content summarization. Defaults to [wigolo](https://github.com/KnockOutEZ/wigolo), a local-first engine with multi-engine search and on-device reranking — $0/query, no API key. Plus a smart-fetch engine with browser-grade TLS fingerprinting. Paid providers as fallbacks, and auto-selection falls through when a provider is unavailable.

**[Image](./packages/image/README.md)** — Generate images from a text prompt and analyze existing ones. 34 image models, plus vision analysis on any model that accepts image input, with a customizable system prompt.

**[MCP](./packages/mcp/README.md)** — Browse 7,800+ MCP servers, add them interactively. Tools from servers register automatically as Pi tools.

**[Notify](./packages/notify/README.md)** — Push notifications to native OS, Gotify, Telegram, or ntfy. Per-event platform routing plus native focus suppression so alerts can stay quiet while Pi is already focused.

**[Footer](./packages/footer/README.md)** — Persistent status bar showing live stats from every package. Now with the Glance footer: a framed input box with an animated rainbow brand, git branch title, and a live session strip (turns, wall/tool time, TTFT, tok/s, cache hit). Responsive layout, presets, per-segment toggling.

**[BTW](./packages/btw/README.md)** — Side conversations that run in parallel. Ask questions without interrupting the main agent.

**[Ask User](./packages/ask-user/README.md)** — Structured input for decision gates. Single-select, multi-select, freeform. The agent asks instead of guessing.

**[Milestone](./packages/milestone/README.md)** — Track project goals across workflow cycles. MILESTONES.md stays in sync with specs, plans, and completed work.

**[Kanboard](./packages/kanboard/README.md)** — Web UI and TUI overlay for kanban boards. Parses all workflow documents into cards with progress indicators.

**[Trajectory](./packages/trajectory/README.md)** — Live localhost session inspector. Explore turns, reasoning, tool payloads/results, timing, token/cache usage, and compactions for the current session.

**[Info Screen](./packages/info-screen/README.md)** — Dashboard overlay showing module status, tools, and custom data groups.

**[Utility](./packages/utility/README.md)** — Environment info, diagnostics, cleanup, name badge, and Shiki-powered diff rendering.

**[Updater](./packages/updater/README.md)** — Checks npm for new versions on session start. Changelog browser and readme browser in TUI overlays.

**[Input Shortcuts](./packages/input-shortcuts/README.md)** — Keyboard shortcuts via vim-style chord overlay. Stash/restore, undo/redo, clipboard, thinking toggle.

**[Command Enchantment](./packages/autocomplete/README.md)** — Enhanced `/unipi:*` autocomplete with full command names, package tags, descriptions, colors, and registry audits that catch stale command docs before release.

## Architecture

Packages discover each other through events, not direct imports. Core defines the event types and constants. Every package emits `MODULE_READY` on load and subscribes to events it cares about.

```

Coexists triggers enhance behavior when packages are installed together. Workflow skills detect subagents and inject parallel strategies. All skills get MCP tools when MCP is installed. Web-api adds web research to investigation skills. Each package works standalone.

```

### Adding a Package

1. Create `packages/your-package/` with `package.json` and `index.ts`
2. Depend on `@pi-unipi/core` for constants and events
3. Emit `MODULE_READY` on load
4. Add to umbrella package dependencies and imports
5. Run `npm run typecheck`

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

## Contributing

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Run `npm run typecheck` and `npm test`
5. Submit a pull request

Keep packages focused. One package, one responsibility. Use events for cross-package communication — no direct imports between packages.
