/**
 * Immune interceptor — warn-mode (the advisory half of Proposal 01).
 *
 * Before a file-mutating tool call lands, the active memory rules and the
 * file's pain score are checked and any hazard is surfaced to the operator
 * as a warning. This mode **never blocks**: blocking on a probabilistic
 * verdict would invert the consent model; block-mode is reserved for the
 * deterministic contract-backed rules of Proposal 03.
 *
 * Pure decision logic lives here (testable without pi); the thin event
 * subscription sits in hooks/immune_interceptor.ts and is wired — tracked —
 * in the composition root, per the hook-purity rule.
