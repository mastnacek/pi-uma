### Context
Every UMA change needs the same verification sequence, and skipping part of it has already caused a miss. A release build can emit warnings while `cargo test` reports clean, because tests only compile `cfg(test)` code: an unused field warned in `cargo build --release` but not in `cargo test`, and AGENTS.md requires **zero** warnings.

This skill was first created without its `template` (the running extension predated the `template` parameter and stripped it), so `uma skill invoke` reported "no invocation template". This revision restores it.

### Procedure
Run from the repo root after any Rust or extension change:
1. `cd uma && cargo test` — must pass with 0 warnings
2. `cargo build --release` — a *separate* check; warnings that exist only outside `cfg(test)` show up here and nowhere else
3. `cd ../uma-pi-extension && npm run typecheck && npm run test`
4. If extension code changed, `/reload` before exercising tools in Pi — a running session keeps the old module graph loaded

For anything that writes memory, rehearse in a throwaway repo first (`mktemp -d && git init -q .`) so no test run can touch the real store.

### Consequences
- Template, type, and formatting regressions are caught before they are committed.
- Never claim a change is verified from `cargo test` alone — the release build is a distinct gate.
- Step 4 is not theoretical: ignoring it silently produced this very broken skill.
