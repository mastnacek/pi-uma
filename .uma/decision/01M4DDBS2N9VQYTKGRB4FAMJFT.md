### Context
Google's Open Knowledge Format (OKF) v0.2 is an open, vendor-neutral standard for representing knowledge as Markdown + YAML frontmatter. UMA already used that shape, so aligning avoids inventing a bespoke format.

### Decision
UMA facts are valid OKF v0.2 concept documents, extended with UMA-specific keys:
- OKF keys: type, title, description, tags, status (stable|deprecated|draft), generated {by,at}, verified [{by,at}], since, until, stale_after.
- UMA extensions: id (ULID), scope (global | project:<name>), supersedes (ULID).
- Trust tier is derived from verified: human: actor => human-reviewed.

### Consequences
- Bundles are portable and readable by any OKF-aware tool; no lock-in.
- Supersession maps onto OKF lifecycle (status: deprecated + until) instead of a custom scheme.
- The migration slice (uma migrate) rewrites legacy files and backfills provenance.
