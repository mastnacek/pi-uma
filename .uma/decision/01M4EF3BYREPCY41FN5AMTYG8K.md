## Context

During the Antigravity/Gemini integration work on the Mozek application (session imported from 2026-09-14), the operator set the role of embeddings in the app.

## Rule

Embeddings serve **only summarization in the News tab**. They are not a search mechanism and must not be added to search or other features without a new decision.

## Consequences

- No vector-search infrastructure belongs in Mozek's backend.
- Feature requests that imply embedding-based search need explicit operator approval first.
