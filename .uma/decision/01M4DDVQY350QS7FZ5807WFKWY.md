### Context
Slice S3 would auto-surface top-N memories into the model's context each turn. Deciding what to inject is unreliable: relevance is query-dependent, and injecting stale or off-topic facts adds noise and can push the model toward acting on wrong information. It also spends context budget on every turn.

### Decision
Slice S3 (Auto-Recall & Context Injection) is ON HOLD / `[?]`, not cancelled. UMA favors:
- explicit, on-demand retrieval (`uma_search`, hybrid mode), and
- operator-approved writes via the approval modal,
so the agent pulls what it needs and the human gates what is stored.

### Consequences
- No silent context pollution; token cost stays predictable.
- Revisit only with a high-precision selector and an explicit opt-in switch.
