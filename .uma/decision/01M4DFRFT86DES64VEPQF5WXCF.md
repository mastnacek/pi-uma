### Context
An earlier version of this decision listed `uma_consolidate` among the tools guarded by the `tool_call` hook. That was written before the slice existed, from the PRD's planned tool list.

### Decision
The gate guards exactly the tools that mutate the store: **`uma_write` and `uma_supersede`**. A `tool_call` hook (`uma-pi-extension/src/hooks/approval_gate.ts`) is fail-closed: a mutation is allowed only when an interactive TUI approval UI exists (the tool then shows its modal) **or** the operator enabled `autoApprove`. It is blocked in `pi -p`, RPC, JSON and nested `codemode` calls.

### Consequences
- `uma_consolidate` is deliberately **not** gated. It only proposes merges and contradictions and never writes; gating a read would make approval routine and therefore meaningless.
- Adding a future mutating tool means adding one entry to `MEMORY_MUTATING_TOOLS` — the guard is centralized, never duplicated per tool.
- The gated set is locked by a test asserting it is exactly `{uma_write, uma_supersede}`.
