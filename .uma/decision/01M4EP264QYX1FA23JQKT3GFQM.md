## Context

The immune interceptor (proposal 01) checks memory rules and the pain score before file-mutating tool calls land. A probabilistic verdict (Jev/router, confidence != 1.0) must never silently veto agent work — that would invert the fail-closed consent model.

## Rule

The interceptor ships warn-only: hazards surface as UI warnings, the operator decides. Auto-block may only be introduced for contract-backed rules (proposal 03: deterministic ast-grep contracts with a passing test proving the rule), never for model-judged violations.

## Consequences

- Every warning is advisory; agent work can never hang on the interceptor (bounded timeouts, fail-silent).
- Block-mode is gated on P03a landing, not on judge confidence thresholds.
