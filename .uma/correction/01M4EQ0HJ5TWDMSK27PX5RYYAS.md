## Context

Found while building the import flow: uma-core/src/store/ops.rs reset validity.since to now on every supersession (store_revision), silently moving every claim's origin forward and making the supersede --since flag a no-op at the storage layer.

## Rule

A supersession restates the claim: store_revision in uma-core/src/store/ops.rs must preserve the caller-provided validity.since; only an explicit caller override (imports restoring an origin date) may move it.

## Consequences

- Revisions inherit the predecessor's origin by default.
- The timeline shows revision times from generated.at, not since.
