### Context
The approval modal lives in the Pi extension's tool implementations. The `uma` CLI has **no approval code at all** — `uma write` writes unconditionally. This causes a recurring confusion: it looks like the skill "enables" or "controls" approval, when it cannot.

### Pattern
Approval is a property of the **tool path**, never of a skill:
- A skill cannot grant, weaken, or implement approval — skills are instructions, not enforcement.
- The CLI is unconditional by design: it is the scriptable interface used by agents in other harnesses, so invoking it bypasses operator consent entirely.
- Therefore: never use the `uma` CLI to perform a memory write that the approval gate blocked. That defeats the consent contract.

### Consequences
- "The skill allowed the write" is never a correct explanation; the only gates are the hook, the modal, and `autoApprove`.
- An agent that must write in a non-interactive context needs `autoApprove`, not a CLI workaround.
- The CLI remains correct for automation and for direct human use, where consent is the human typing the command.
