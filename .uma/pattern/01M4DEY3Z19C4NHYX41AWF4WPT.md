### Context
An earlier pattern described a single skill at `skills/uma-memory/` loaded into Pi via `.pi/settings.json` (`"skills": ["../skills"]`), on the premise that duplicating the skill was the problem. That premise was wrong: the real requirement is two *different* documents for two audiences.

### Pattern
- `skills/uma-memory/SKILL.md` — the harness-agnostic skill. Pi loads it by declaring the repo directory in project settings: `.pi/settings.json` → `{ "skills": ["../skills"] }` (project-settings resource paths resolve relative to the project `.pi` directory).
- `.pi/skills/uma-memory-pi/SKILL.md` — the Pi-specific skill, discovered natively by Pi.

Both load into Pi under **distinct names**, so there is no collision. The Pi skill references the general file by path for shared concepts.

### Consequences
- Verified: a non-interactive Pi run reports both `uma-memory` and `uma-memory-pi`.
- The general skill stays correct for agents that have no Pi tools.
- Supporting a third harness means adding its own skill, not growing the general one.
