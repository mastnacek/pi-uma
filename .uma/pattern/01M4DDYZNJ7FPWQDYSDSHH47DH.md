### Context
`reindex_from_dirs` began with `DELETE FROM facts_fts` and then scanned only the roots it was handed (global + current project). Reindexing from one repository silently removed every other project's rows from the shared index.

### Pattern
Before wiping a rebuildable cache, recover the full set of roots already known to it. Here that means reading `SELECT DISTINCT file_path` and deriving each store root as the grandparent of `<root>/<type>/<id>.md`, then scanning those roots too. Roots that no longer exist are skipped, which is exactly the orphan-pruning behaviour we want.

### Consequences
- Cross-project search survives a reindex run from any single project.
- Missing/deleted roots are pruned as a side effect, with no separate cleanup pass.
- Embeddings are pruned to the rebuilt fact set in the same step.
