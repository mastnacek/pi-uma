## Context

The approval modal used to rebuild the approved proposal from only the editable fields, silently dropping supersedes/template/stale_after/since — masked for months by CLI-side inheritance, exposed by the first import that carried a 'since'.

## Rule

Whatever the tool proposed and the operator approved is the stored contract. The modal spreads the full initial proposal (edited fields on top); adding an optional field to a tool MUST include passing it through modal, args, and CLI/MCP counterparts.

## Consequences

- New proposal fields need round-trip coverage in all three surfaces (Pi tool, CLI flag, MCP param).
- A fact that stores wrong after approval is a modal/passthrough defect, not an authoring error.
