### Context
Hook logic entangled with `pi.on(...)` registration cannot be unit-tested, and ad-hoc subscriptions leak into later sessions.

### Pattern
- `evaluateApprovalGate(event, ctx, state)` is a **pure function** returning `{ block: true, reason }` or `undefined`. It is unit-tested directly — no engine, no UI, no I/O (6 cases in `test/approval_gate.test.ts`).
- The composition root (`index.ts`) owns the subscription: `track(pi.on("tool_call", ...))`, where `track` pushes the returned unsubscribe into `state.unsubscribers`.
- `session_shutdown` drains `state.unsubscribers`, so a reload or session end leaves no live hooks behind.

### Consequences
- The approval decision is testable without a running editor.
- Lifecycle cleanup becomes a structural invariant: subscriptions are always created through `track`, never stored ad hoc.
- Slice code stays free of engine registration, which matches slice isolation in VSA.
