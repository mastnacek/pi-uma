### Context
`Store::write` unconditionally opened the shared central index and inserted a row. Tests and any temporary `Store::new(tempdir)` therefore wrote their markdown to a temp folder but pushed the index row (and an embedding) into the production database. Result: 28 index rows against 9 real facts, 154 orphan embeddings, and `Note 1`/`Note 2` noise in semantic search — a hidden, growing corruption of the shared cache.

### Pattern
Gate shared-state side effects on whether the actor is entitled to touch that state. `Store::is_canonical()` returns true only for the global root or the current project's `.uma`; only those feed the central index. Ad-hoc stores write Markdown and nothing else.

### Consequences
- Tests are hermetic and fast (they no longer make network calls for embeddings).
- No orphan rows or embeddings can accumulate from temp/throwaway stores.
- A regression test asserts a non-canonical store leaves the central index untouched.
