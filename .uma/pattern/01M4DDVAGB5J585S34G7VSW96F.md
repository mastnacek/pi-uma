### Context
A skill placed only in `skills/uma-memory/` is invisible to Pi, whose default discovery is `.pi/skills/`. Copying it into `.pi/skills/` creates a second file that silently drifts from the original.

### Pattern
Declare the repo skills directory in project settings instead of duplicating:
`.pi/settings.json` -> `{ "skills": ["../skills"] }`
Project-settings resource paths resolve relative to the project `.pi` directory, so `../skills` points at the repo's `skills/` folder. Pi discovers it (verified: a non-interactive Pi run lists `uma-memory`).

### Consequences
- Exactly one copy of the skill; no drift.
- The same file also serves other harnesses that read `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
- Project skills require project trust, like extensions.
